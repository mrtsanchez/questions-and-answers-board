    "questiontitle": "Bank Comissions on International Wires ",
    "author": "Jhon Snow",
    "category": "Banking",
    "details": "<p>I was wondering if anybody had experience on international wires. </p><p>Particularly, I am interested in the comission that banks charge... There are two types of comission: </p><p> 1. For the wire itself... i.e. to send the money. It's normally a flat rate or fix amount. Not very significant. </p><p> 2. For the currency exchange... let's say buying USD from Euros. This comission is a percentage and it may become a very significant amount of money. </p><p>I am mostly worried about the second comission or currency exchange comission. My research on two Spanish banks (BBVA and La Caixa) shows that, to purchase USD from EUROS, they charge you 0.65 % and 0.5 % of comission... </p><p>Does anybody know if this is as good as it gets? Or did you guys enjoy lower rates? </p><p> Thanks a lot!</p>",

    "details": "<p>Dear All, </p><p> I am considering to move to Portland for work, and before I can make a call, I need to do the maths and check how much my cost of living would be over there. I guess rent would play a major role on my expenses, so I would like to ask you guys some questions. </p><p> Which neighborhoods do you recommend me to look at? I would like something with a good balance between being safe, not too expensive and not too far from downtonw. </p><p> Also, which websites would you recommend me to use for doing some research? </p><p> Thanks, </p> <p>Fabio</p>",
