    "answer": "<p>Hi David, </p><p> Citibank charges USD 30 per wire (flat fee, your point 1). My experience is that wiring money to Europe in USD instead of EUR gives you a much better exchange rate.</p><p> When I wire money into my German account, my German bank uses pretty much the interbank exchange rate to convert the USD amount into EUR, whereas Citi charges almost 2.5% (!) for wiring EUR from the U.S. to Germany. </p><p> Don't know how this works the other way round, i.e., wiring EUR from a European account into a U.S. account, as I've never done this. </p><p> Hope this might be helpful. </p><p> Cheers, </p><p> Manuela</p>",
