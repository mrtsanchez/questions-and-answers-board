    "answer": "Hi David, /n Citibank charges USD 30 per wire (flat fee, your point 1). My experience is that wiring money to Europe in USD instead of EUR gives you a much better exchange rate. When I wire money into my German account, my German bank uses pretty much the interbank exchange rate to convert the USD amount into EUR, whereas Citi charges almost 2.5% (!) for wiring EUR from the U.S. to Germany. /n Don't know how this works the other way round, i.e., wiring EUR from a European account into a U.S. account, as I've never done this. /n Hope this might be helpful. /n Cheers, /n Manuela",
